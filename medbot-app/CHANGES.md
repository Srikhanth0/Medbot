# MedBot Application Changes

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to remove the health page and improve ECG data visibility, storage, and analytics.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Health Page
- Deleted `HealthPage.tsx` from the pages directory
- Updated `App.tsx` to remove health page imports and routing
- Updated `Layout.tsx` and `Sidebar.tsx` to remove health page from navigation
- Updated mobile navigation to include Integration page instead of Health page

### 2. Enhanced Analytics Page
- Updated `AnalyticsPage.tsx` to use the new ECG data storage system
- Added main metrics display with heart rate, rhythm, severity, and confidence
- Added data statistics section showing total records, average heart rate, and distribution
- Added trend analysis section for heart rate and severity trends
- Updated recent activity to show actual ECG uploads instead of generic activities
- Integrated with `ECGDataStorage` for automatic data access

### 3. Fixed ECG Data Visibility in Integration Page
- Updated styling in `IntegrationPage.tsx` to ensure ECG analysis details are visible
- Added proper text colors (`text-blue-900`, `text-yellow-900`) to prevent white text on white background
- Enhanced the ECG analysis display with better contrast and readability

### 4. Implemented Structured Data Storage
- Created `ecgDataStorage.ts` utility for storing ECG data in label/data format
- Data structure includes:
  - Heart rate with label, data, and unit
  - Blood pressure with label, data, systolic, and diastolic
  - Severity with label, data, and level (low/medium/high/critical)
  - Symptoms with label and data array
  - Rhythm with label, data, and confidence
  - Urgency with label, data, and level
  - Recommendations with label and data array
  - Medical advice with label and data

### 5. Enhanced Gemini Integration
- Created `geminiDataProvider.ts` utility to format data for Gemini prompts
- Updated server endpoints to store and provide ECG data to Gemini
- Added `/api/store-ecg-data` endpoint to store structured ECG data
- Added `/api/ecg-data-for-gemini` endpoint to provide formatted data to Gemini
- Updated Gemini endpoint to use stored ECG data when medical queries are made
- Enhanced context detection to include blood pressure, severity, and symptoms

### 6. Server-Side Improvements
- Added in-memory storage for ECG data in `server.js`
- Created helper functions to store and retrieve ECG data for Gemini
- Enhanced the Gemini endpoint to provide comprehensive patient data
- Added proper error handling for data storage operations

### 7. Analytics Metrics Access
- Analytics page now automatically accesses stored ECG data
- Real-time metrics calculation based on uploaded ECG files
- Trend analysis for heart rate and severity patterns
- Distribution statistics for severity and urgency levels
- Recent uploads display with file names and key metrics

## Data Flow

1. **Upload**: User uploads ECG file in Integration page
2. **Processing**: File is analyzed and structured data is created
3. **Storage**: Data is stored locally and sent to server
4. **Analytics**: Analytics page automatically accesses and displays metrics
5. **Gemini**: Medical queries can access comprehensive patient data

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Removed redundant health page, focused analytics on main metrics
2. **Improved Visibility**: Fixed ECG data display issues with proper contrast
3. **Structured Data**: Consistent label/data format for all medical information
4. **Enhanced AI**: Gemini can now access comprehensive patient data for better medical advice
5. **Real-time Analytics**: Automatic metrics calculation and trend analysis
6. **Scalable Storage**: Structured data format allows for easy expansion and analysis

## Usage

1. Upload ECG files in the Integration page
2. View analytics and trends in the Analytics page
3. Ask medical questions to Gemini (it will have access to your ECG data)
4. Monitor your health metrics and trends over time

The application now provides a more focused and data-driven approach to ECG analysis and health monitoring.
